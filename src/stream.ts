/**
 * Real-time Robinhood Chain WebSocket streaming client.
 *
 * Wraps the connect → token → subscribe → event loop with auto-reconnect,
 * heartbeat liveness, and typed events, so consumers never hand-roll
 * connection management. The stream token is fetched on every (re)connect;
 * stream tokens never expire (since 2026-08-27), so there is no refresh
 * timer — a `4001` close means the token was rotated or the subscription
 * lapsed, and the reconnect simply mints again. Obtain one via `client.stream()`.
 *
 * Channels are RHC-scoped: `rhc:kol_trades` (the KOL tape), `rhc:dex_trades`
 * (the full DEX firehose, ULTRA+) plus `rhc:dex_trades_unattributed` and
 * `rhc:new_tokens` (ULTRA+), `rhc:token_locks`, `rhc:token_prices` (address-
 * scoped: subscribe with `filters.addresses`, get one `snapshot: true` frame per
 * address then coalesced ticks, each with `quality` fresh | stale | unreliable
 * — see `RhcTokenPriceTick`), and the four rule-engine channels
 * (`rhc:copytrade:signals`, `rhc:price_alert:events` — event-driven off each
 * RHC trade, with table polls as a safety net — `rhc:kol:coordination`,
 * `rhc:kol:first_touches`). Same wire protocol as the Solana stream client.
 *
 * Recovery (v1 resume): the client remembers a cursor `{instance, seq, ts}` —
 * the last frame whose handlers finished — and on every reconnect asks the
 * server to resume after it (`subscribe {…, resume}`); against an older server
 * it falls back to `replay_since_seq` (same process) / `replay_since_ts`
 * (restarted). Delivery is at-least-once, de-duplicated by event `id`; a
 * `"gap"` event says what could NOT be recovered. `seq` gaps are normal and
 * never mean loss. Close codes: 4001 re-fetches the token (bounded, then
 * `"fatal"`), 4002 (connection limit) waits ≥ 60 s, 4003 stops with
 * `"fatal"`, 4008 (slow consumer) reconnects and resumes.
 *
 * Works in Node (uses the global `WebSocket` on Node 22+, else lazily imports
 * the optional `ws` package) and the browser (native WebSocket). Zero required
 * dependencies.

 *  - `getCursor()` — the COMMITTED cursor, the only one to persist and resume from.

 * until a recovery completes — so the next reconnect re-requests the
 * unrecovered range (duplicates are dropped by id). Call `acceptGap()` once
 * you have backfilled (or decided to skip) the range. `instance` identifies the server process
 * (seq restarts when it changes), `seq` is the server's global ordinal and
